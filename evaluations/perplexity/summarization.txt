To summarize a paragraph effectively, you can follow these steps:

## Read and Understand
Read the paragraph carefully, possibly more than once, to identify the main idea and supporting details[1][4][5].

## Identify Key Elements
Note down the key words, phrases, and the main idea of the paragraph. Also, identify any supporting details that are crucial to understanding the main idea[1][4][5].

## Write the Summary
Using your notes, write a concise summary that states the main idea followed by the most important supporting details. Aim to keep the summary short, typically one or two sentences.

Here is an example of how you might summarize a paragraph:

### Original Paragraph
"The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are a natural phenomenon where the night sky glows with bands of color. These bands can start as cloud shapes and spread into a great arc across the sky. They may fall in folds like a curtain drawn across the heavens. The lights usually grow brighter, then suddenly dim. During this time, the sky glows with pale yellow, pink, green, violet, blue, and red. Scientists have been studying them for hundreds of years but are still unsure of their cause. In ancient times, people were afraid of the Lights, imagining fiery dragons in the sky."

### Summary
The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, are colorful bands in the night sky, with scientists still unsure of their cause despite centuries of study. Ancient people feared these lights, believing they saw fiery dragons in the sky[1].

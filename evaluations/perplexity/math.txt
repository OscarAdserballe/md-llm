To evaluate the integral of \(x^2\) from 0 to 3, you can use the formula for the indefinite integral of \(x^2\) and then apply the limits of integration.

The indefinite integral of \(x^2\) is given by:
\[
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
\]
where \(C\) is the constant of integration. However, for a definite integral, we do not need the constant \(C\).

Using the formula for the definite integral:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{a}^{b}
\]
Substitute \(a = 0\) and \(b = 3\):
\[
\int_{0}^{3} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{3} = \frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3}
\]
Calculate the values:
\[
\frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{27}{3} - 0 = 9
\]

Therefore, the integral of \(x^2\) from 0 to 3 is:
\[
\int_{0}^{3} x^2 \, dx = 9

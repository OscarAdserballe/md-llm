To evaluate the definite integral of \( x^2 \) from 0 to 3, we can follow these steps:

\[
\int_{0}^{3} x^2 \, dx
\]

1. **Find the Indefinite Integral:**

   The integral of \( x^2 \) with respect to \( x \) is:

   \[
   \int x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C
   \]

   where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

2. **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**

   Apply the limits of integration from 0 to 3:

   \[
   \left[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 \right]_0^3 = \frac{1}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{1}{3}(27) - 0
   \]

   \[
   = 9
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The integral of \( x^2 \) from 0 to 3 is **9**.

The fog clung to the narrow alleys of Victorian London like a shroud, muffling the clamor of horse-drawn carriages and the distant tolling of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Gas lamps cast wavering pools of light onto cobblestone streets, where shadows danced with secrets untold. Detective Eleanor Blackwood stood beneath a flickering lamp outside the decrepit Blackthorne Manor, her breath visible in the chill night air. A single, cryptic letter had summoned her here, promising revelations that could unravel the very fabric of the city’s darkest mysteries. As the wind whispered through the wrought-iron gates, she felt the weight of the unknown pressing upon her, heralding a night where every corner could conceal danger—and every clue could lead to the truth.
